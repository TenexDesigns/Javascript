In JavaScript, the break and continue statements are used to control the flow of loops.

break statement:
The break statement is used to immediately terminate the execution of a loop, whether it is a for loop, while loop, or do-while loop. It allows you to exit the loop prematurely based on a certain condition. Once the break statement is encountered, the program execution continues with the statement immediately following the loop.

Here's an example of using the break statement:

javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
In this example, the loop will iterate from 0 to 4. However, when i becomes 3, the break statement is encountered, and the loop terminates. The output will be:

Copy code
0
1
2
continue statement:
The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It allows you to bypass certain code blocks within the loop based on a certain condition. When the continue statement is encountered, the loop immediately jumps to the next iteration without executing the remaining code within the loop body.

Here's an example of using the continue statement:

javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
In this example, when i is equal to 2, the continue statement is encountered. It skips the console.log(i) statement and moves on to the next iteration. The output will be:

Copy code
0
1
3
4
Both break and continue statements provide ways to control the flow of loops and make the execution more flexible. The break statement allows you to exit the loop entirely, while the continue statement allows you to skip certain code blocks within the loop and move on to the next iteration.
