In JavaScript, you can define functions inside other functions, known as nested functions or inner functions. Nested functions have access to the variables and scope of the outer function, creating a closure. This allows for more modular and encapsulated code.

Here's an example of a nested function:

javascript
Copy code
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = 'Hello';

  function innerFunction() {
    const innerVariable = 'World';
    console.log(outerVariable + ' ' + innerVariable);
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction(); // Output: Hello World
In this example, the innerFunction is defined inside the outerFunction. The innerFunction has access to the outerVariable defined in the outer function's scope. When outerFunction is called, it executes the innerFunction, which logs the concatenated value of outerVariable and innerVariable.

Nested functions are useful in scenarios where you want to encapsulate functionality within a specific scope or create helper functions that are only relevant within the outer function's context. They can improve code organization and maintainability by keeping related functions close together.

It's important to note that nested functions are defined anew every time the outer function is called. This means that each invocation of the outer function creates a new instance of the nested function, with its own separate scope and closure.

In JavaScript, a closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. It allows a function to access variables from an outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Closures are created when an inner function is defined inside an outer function and the inner function retains a reference to the variables of the outer function. The inner function can access and manipulate these variables, even when the outer function has already returned.

Here's an example to illustrate closures:

javascript
Copy code
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = 'Hello';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const myFunction = outerFunction();
myFunction(); // Output: Hello
In this example, the innerFunction is defined inside the outerFunction and it references the outerVariable. When outerFunction is called, it returns the innerFunction, which is then assigned to the myFunction variable. When myFunction is invoked, it still has access to the outerVariable through the closure, and it can log its value.

Closures are powerful because they allow for data encapsulation and private variables in JavaScript. The variables within the outer function are not accessible from outside, but the inner function can still access and use them. This helps in creating modular and reusable code.

Closures are commonly used in scenarios such as creating private variables and functions, implementing function factories, and handling asynchronous operations where you need to preserve the state of variables between function invocations.

It's important to be mindful of memory usage when working with closures, as they can keep the outer variables in memory even when they are no longer needed.
