Yes, you're correct! Higher-order functions (HOFs) are functions that either take functions as arguments, return functions, or both. Let's break down the two cases:

### 1. Higher-Order Functions that Take Functions as Arguments:

```javascript
// Example of a Higher-Order Function taking a function as an argument
function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
  console.log("Executing the higher-order function");
  callback(); // Here, we're invoking the function passed as an argument
}

// Example of a function passed as an argument to a higher-order function
function callbackFunction() {
  console.log("I'm the callback function");
}

// Using the higher-order function with the callback function
higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction);
```

In this case, `higherOrderFunction` is a higher-order function because it takes another function (`callbackFunction`) as an argument.

### 2. Higher-Order Functions that Return Functions:

```javascript
// Example of a Higher-Order Function returning a function
function higherOrderFunction() {
  console.log("Creating and returning a new function");
  
  // Returning a new function
  return function() {
    console.log("I'm the returned function");
  };
}

// Using the higher-order function to get a new function
const returnedFunction = higherOrderFunction();

// Invoking the returned function
returnedFunction();
```

In this case, `higherOrderFunction` is a higher-order function because it returns another function. When you call `higherOrderFunction()`, it returns a new function, which is stored in `returnedFunction`. To invoke the returned function, you call `returnedFunction()`.

In some cases, the returned function may have access to variables from the scope of the higher-order function, creating closures.

```javascript
function createMultiplier(factor) {
  // Returning a new function that has access to the 'factor' variable
  return function(x) {
    return x * factor;
  };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
```

Here, `createMultiplier` is a higher-order function that returns a function (`double`). The returned function has access to the `factor` variable from the outer scope, creating a closure.

In summary, higher-order functions are a powerful concept in functional programming, allowing you to create more flexible and reusable code by treating functions as first-class citizens.
