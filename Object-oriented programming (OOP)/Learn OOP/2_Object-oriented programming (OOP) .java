To learn about object-oriented programming in JavaScript, there are a few key concepts and topics you should be familiar with:

1. Objects and Classes: JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means that objects can be created by cloning existing objects. Understanding how to create and work with objects is essential.

2. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods together within an object. It helps to organize code and prevent direct access to internal data.

3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. It helps to create a hierarchy of objects and promotes code reuse.

4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as if they were the same type. It enables code to be written in a more generic and flexible way.

5. Design Patterns: Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. Learning about design patterns can help you write more maintainable and scalable code.

To learn more about object-oriented programming in JavaScript, you can explore the following resources:

1. MDN Web Docs: The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides comprehensive documentation on JavaScript, including object-oriented programming concepts. You can start with their guide on [Object-oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS).

2. JavaScript.info: JavaScript.info is a popular online resource for learning JavaScript. They have a dedicated section on [Object-oriented programming](https://javascript.info/object-oriented-programming) that covers the fundamentals and advanced topics.

3. Books: There are several books available that cover object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Some recommended titles include "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford and "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke.

4. Online Courses: Platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and Codecademy offer online courses on JavaScript and object-oriented programming. These courses often provide structured learning paths and hands-on exercises.

Remember, practice is key to mastering object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Try implementing small projects and exercises to solidify your understanding of the concepts.
