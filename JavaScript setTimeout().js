setTimeout() = invokes a function after a number of milliseconds            
                           asynchronous function (doesn't pause execution) 









The setTimeout() function in JavaScript is used to schedule the execution of a function after a specified delay in milliseconds. It allows you to delay the execution of code and create time-based events in your applications. The basic syntax of setTimeout() is as follows:

javascript
Copy code
setTimeout(function, delay, param1, param2, ...)
function: The function to be executed after the specified delay.
delay: The delay in milliseconds before executing the function.
param1, param2, ...: Optional parameters to be passed to the function.
Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of setTimeout():

javascript
Copy code
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

// Execute the greet function after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)
setTimeout(greet, 2000, "John");

// Output: Hello, John!
In the above example, the greet function is scheduled to be executed after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). The function is passed as the first parameter to setTimeout(), followed by the delay and any additional parameters.

You can also use setTimeout() with an anonymous function to achieve the same result:

javascript
Copy code
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Delayed execution!");
}, 3000);

// Output: Delayed execution! (after 3 seconds)
The setTimeout() function returns a unique identifier (a numeric value) that represents the timer. This identifier can be used to cancel the execution of the function using the clearTimeout() function:

javascript
Copy code
var timerId = setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This will not be executed!");
}, 5000);

// Cancel the execution of the function
clearTimeout(timerId);
By calling clearTimeout() with the timer identifier, you can prevent the function from executing if it hasn't already.

setTimeout() is commonly used for implementing timed animations, delaying the execution of code, creating timers, and performing tasks at specific intervals.

***************************************************************************************


The setTimeout() function in JavaScript is a built-in method that allows you to delay the execution of a function by a specified amount of time. It takes two arguments: the function to be executed and the time delay in milliseconds developer.mozilla.org, freecodecamp.org.

Here's an example of using setTimeout():

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}

setTimeout(greet, 3000); // The greet function will be executed after a delay of 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds)
The setTimeout() function returns a timeout ID, which is a positive integer. You can use this ID to cancel the scheduled execution of the function using the clearTimeout() function programiz.com.

const timeoutID = setTimeout(greet, 3000);

// If you want to cancel the scheduled function execution, you can call clearTimeout with the timeout ID
clearTimeout(timeoutID);
Keep in mind that setTimeout() only schedules the function to be executed once after the specified delay. If you want to repeatedly execute a function with a specified interval, you can use the setInterval() function instead w3schools.com.
