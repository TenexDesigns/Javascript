Template literals, also known as template strings, are a feature in JavaScript that allows for easy string interpolation and multiline strings. They are denoted by backticks ( ) instead of single or double quotes.

Template literals provide the following features:

String Interpolation:

Template literals allow you to embed expressions directly inside a string using the ${expression} syntax.
The expression within ${} will be evaluated and the result will be included in the string.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const name = 'John';
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, John!
Multiline Strings:

With template literals, you can create multiline strings without the need for escape characters or string concatenation.
Line breaks and indentation are preserved within the string.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const message = `
  This is a
  multiline
  string.
`;
console.log(message);
/*
  Output:
  This is a
  multiline
  string.
*/
Expression Evaluation:

Template literals allow the evaluation of expressions within ${}.
These expressions can be simple variables, function calls, or complex JavaScript expressions.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
const result = `The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}.`;
console.log(result); // Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.
Template literals provide a concise and readable way to work with strings in JavaScript, especially when there is a need for string interpolation or multiline strings. They are widely used in modern JavaScript development, including frameworks like React and Vue.js.
