In JavaScript, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed
later at a specific event or when a certain condition is met. Callbacks are a fundamental concept in
JavaScript and are widely used for asynchronous programming, event handling, and functional programming.
Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of callbacks:

javascript
Copy code
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log('Goodbye!');
}

greet('Alice', sayGoodbye);
In the above example, the greet function takes two parameters: name and callback.
  It logs a greeting message with the provided name and then invokes the callback function.

The sayGoodbye function is defined separately and serves as the callback. It simply logs a farewell message.

When you call greet('Alice', sayGoodbye), it logs "Hello, Alice!" and then invokes the sayGoodbye callback function, which logs "Goodbye!".

Callbacks are powerful because they allow you to control the flow of execution and perform actions asynchronously. They are commonly used with functions that perform asynchronous operations, such as making AJAX requests, handling timers, or processing data from external sources. By providing a callback, you can specify what should happen once the asynchronous operation is complete.

Callbacks can also be anonymous functions defined inline without a separate function declaration, making them more concise and convenient for one-time usage.

Note that in modern JavaScript, there are alternative approaches to working with asynchronous operations, such as Promises and async/await, which provide more expressive and readable code. Nonetheless, understanding callbacks is still essential as they form the foundation for many JavaScript patterns and libraries.
