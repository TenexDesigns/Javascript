In JavaScript, function expressions allow you to define functions as expressions and assign them to variables. Function expressions are useful when you need to create a function dynamically or pass a function as an argument to another function.

Here's an example of a function expression:

javascript
Copy code
const sayHello = function() {
  console.log('Hello!');
};

sayHello(); // Output: Hello!
In the above example, a function expression is assigned to the variable sayHello. The function can be invoked using the variable name followed by parentheses (sayHello()), just like any other function.

Function expressions can also include parameters:

javascript
Copy code
const sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(sum(3, 4)); // Output: 7
In this example, the function expression sum takes two parameters (a and b) and returns their sum.

Function expressions can be anonymous, meaning they don't have a name:

javascript
Copy code
const greeting = function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greeting('Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!
In this case, the function expression is assigned to the variable greeting, and it takes a parameter name to print a personalized greeting.

Function expressions can be used in various ways, such as:

Assigning them to variables and using those variables as functions.
Passing them as arguments to other functions.
Returning them from other functions.
Function expressions provide flexibility in defining functions on the fly and enable you to use functions as first-class citizens in JavaScript.
