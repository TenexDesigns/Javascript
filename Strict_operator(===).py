The strict equality operator (===) in JavaScript is used to compare two values for equality without performing type coercion.
It checks both the value and the type of the operands. The result of the strict equality comparison is either true if the values are equal and of the same type, or false otherwise.

Here's how the strict equality operator works:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(5 === 5);         // true
console.log('hello' === 'hello');   // true
console.log(true === true);   // true
console.log(null === null);   // true
console.log(undefined === undefined); // true

console.log(5 === '5');       // false
console.log('hello' === 'Hello');   // false
console.log(true === 1);      // false
console.log(null === undefined); // false
console.log(undefined === null); // false
In the above example, you can see that when using the strict equality operator, if the values being compared are of different types, 
the result is always false, regardless of their actual values.

The strict equality operator is useful when you want to ensure that both the value and type of the operands are the same. 
It is often recommended to use the strict equality operator (===) instead of the loose equality operator (==) to avoid unexpected type coercion.

It's important to note that the strict equality operator is not the same as the assignment operator (=). 
The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable, while the strict equality operator is used to compare values for equality.

javascript
Copy code
let x = 5;

if (x === 5) {
  console.log("x is equal to 5");
}
In the example above, the code inside the if statement will execute only if the value of x is strictly equal to 5.
