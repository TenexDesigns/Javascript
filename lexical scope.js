In JavaScript, lexical scope refers to the scope visibility or accessibility of variables, functions, and objects based on their physical location or position in the source code. The scope is determined by the placement of variables and functions in the code, and it is primarily determined by the location of the code within nested functions and blocks.

Lexical scope follows a hierarchical structure, where each nested function or block has access to variables and functions defined in its outer scopes. However, the outer scopes cannot access variables defined in inner scopes.

Here's an example to illustrate lexical scope:

javascript
Copy code
function outer() {
  const outerVariable = 'I am in the outer scope';

  function inner() {
    const innerVariable = 'I am in the inner scope';

    console.log(outerVariable); // Accessible: outerVariable is in the outer scope
    console.log(innerVariable); // Accessible: innerVariable is in the inner scope
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
In this example, the outer function has access to its own variable outerVariable. The inner function, defined inside the outer function, has access to both outerVariable and its own variable innerVariable. However, the outer function cannot directly access the innerVariable.

Lexical scoping allows for encapsulation and the creation of private variables. By defining variables within a function, they are not accessible outside that function, creating a form of data privacy.

It's important to understand lexical scope in JavaScript as it plays a vital role in determining variable accessibility and resolving variable names within different nested scopes.
