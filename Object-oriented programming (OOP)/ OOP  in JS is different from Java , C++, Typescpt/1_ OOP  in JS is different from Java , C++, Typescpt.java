Apologies for any confusion caused. Let me clarify.

JavaScript is a versatile language that supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. However, the implementation of OOP in JavaScript differs from languages like Java or C++. While JavaScript does not have built-in class-based inheritance, it uses prototype-based inheritance instead.

In class-based inheritance, objects are created from classes, and classes define the structure and behavior of objects. In JavaScript, objects are created directly from other objects through prototypal inheritance. This means that objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects, without the need for classes.

JavaScript also supports other OOP concepts like encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. You can create objects, define properties and methods, and organize your code in an object-oriented manner.

TypeScript, on the other hand, is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and class-based inheritance to the language. By using TypeScript, you can bring more traditional class-based OOP concepts to JavaScript, similar to what you would find in languages like Java or C++.

So, to answer your question, OOP in JavaScript is different from languages like Java or C++, but it is still a powerful paradigm. If you prefer a more class-based approach to OOP, you can use TypeScript to bring those concepts into JavaScript. However, it's important to note that JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance has its own advantages and can be leveraged effectively in many scenarios.
