Whether TypeScript is better than JavaScript for large-scale projects depends on the specific project and the preferences of the developers involved. However, there are some general advantages and disadvantages to each language that can be considered.

**TypeScript**

**Advantages:**

* **Strong typing:** TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that variables must have a declared type before they can be used. This can help to catch type errors at compile time, which can save time and prevent bugs from being introduced into production code.
* **Better tooling:** TypeScript has a number of tools that can help developers to write better code, such as type checking, autocompletion, and code refactoring.
* **More modular code:** TypeScript can help to make code more modular by making it easier to create reusable components.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Steeper learning curve:** TypeScript is a more complex language than JavaScript, so it can be more difficult to learn.
* **Compile time:** TypeScript code must be compiled to JavaScript before it can be run, which can add some overhead to the development process.

**JavaScript**

**Advantages:**

* **Ease of use:** JavaScript is a relatively easy language to learn and use.
* **Large community:** There is a large community of JavaScript developers, so there are many resources available to help you learn and use the language.
* **No compile time:** JavaScript code does not need to be compiled, so it can be run immediately.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Dynamic typing:** JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables do not have a declared type. This can lead to type errors at runtime, which can be difficult to debug.
* **Less tooling:** JavaScript does not have as many tools as TypeScript to help developers write better code.
* **Less modular code:** JavaScript can be more difficult to make modular than TypeScript.

**Learning OOP**

If you are learning OOP, you can use either TypeScript or JavaScript. TypeScript can help you to learn the concepts of OOP more quickly and easily, as it can help to catch type errors that would otherwise be difficult to spot. However, if you are already familiar with JavaScript, you can learn OOP using JavaScript as well.

Ultimately, the best way to learn OOP is to practice writing code using OOP principles. There are many resources available to help you learn OOP, such as online tutorials, books, and coding bootcamps.

Here are some resources where you can learn OOP:

* **FreeCodeCamp's Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript course:** This free course will teach you the basics of OOP in JavaScript, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
* **JavaScript Objects and Classes:** This article from MDN Web Docs provides a comprehensive overview of objects and classes in JavaScript.
* **Understanding Classes in JavaScript:** This article from JavaScript.info explains how to create and use classes in JavaScript.
* **Object-Oriented JavaScript:** This book by Douglas Crockford is a classic text on OOP in JavaScript.

I hope this helps!
