JavaScript objects can be passed as arguments to functions just like any other data type. 
When you pass an object to a function, the function can access and modify the properties of the object stackoverflow.com.
Heres an example of how to pass an object as an argument to a function:

function displayInfo(person) {
    console.log(`Name: ${person.name}, Age: ${person.age}`);
}

const personObj = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30
};

displayInfo(personObj); // Output: Name: John Doe, Age: 30
You can also pass an object literal as an argument to a function directly:

function displayInfo(person) {
    console.log(`Name: ${person.name}, Age: ${person.age}`);
}

displayInfo({ name: "Jane Doe", age: 28 }); // Output: Name: Jane Doe, Age: 28

When passing an object to a function, the object is passed by reference. This means that any modifications made to the object within the function will also affect the original object outside the function dummies.com.

For example:

function updateName(person, newName) {
    person.name = newName;
}

const personObj = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30
};

updateName(personObj, "Jack Smith");
console.log(personObj.name); // Output: Jack Smith
In this example, the updateName function modifies the name property of the personObj object, and the change is reflected in the original object outside of the function.

In conclusion, you can pass JavaScript objects as arguments to functions, and they will be passed by reference. This means that any modifications made to the object within the function will also affect the original object outside the function dummies.com.

In JavaScript, you can pass objects as arguments to functions. 
This allows you to pass multiple values or properties as a single argument,
  providing a convenient way to organize and pass complex data.

Heres an example that demonstrates passing an object as an argument to a function:

javascript
Copy code
function greet(person) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${person.name}! You are ${person.age} years old.`);
}

const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

greet(person);
In the above example, we define a function called greet that takes an object person as an argument. 
The object has properties name and age. Inside the function, 
  we access the properties of the person object to display a greeting message.

When invoking the greet function, we pass the person object as the argument. 
This allows the function to access and use the properties of the object.

Passing objects as arguments is particularly useful when you need to pass multiple related values or properties together. 
It helps keep the code organized and avoids the need for passing individual values separately.
Additionally, objects can be modified and updated within the function, allowing for more flexibility in manipulating data.
