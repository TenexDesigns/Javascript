Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are entities that have data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP allows you to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

Here are some of the key concepts in OOP that you need to know:

* **Classes:** Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the attributes and methods that an object will have.
* **Objects:** Objects are instances of classes. They have their own set of attributes and methods that are specific to that object.
* **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows you to create new classes that inherit the attributes and methods of existing classes. This can help you to reuse code and avoid duplication.
* **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal data and methods of an object from the outside world. This helps to protect the data and make the code more modular.
* **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. This means that you can write code that works with different objects without having to know their specific type.

Here are some resources where you can learn object-oriented programming in JavaScript:

* **FreeCodeCamp's Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript course:** This free course will teach you the basics of OOP in JavaScript, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
* **JavaScript Objects and Classes:** This article from MDN Web Docs provides a comprehensive overview of objects and classes in JavaScript.
* **Understanding Classes in JavaScript:** This article from JavaScript.info explains how to create and use classes in JavaScript.
* **Object-Oriented JavaScript:** This book by Douglas Crockford is a classic text on OOP in JavaScript.

In addition to these resources, there are many other online tutorials, articles, and books that can teach you about OOP in JavaScript. The most important thing is to practice what you learn by writing your own code.
