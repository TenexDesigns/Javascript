console.time() = Starts a timer you can use to 
                 track how long a synchronous(It does not wait for asynchronous code to excute) operation takes
                 Give each timer a unique name.

//start
console.time("Response time");

alert("CLICK THE OK BUTTON!");

//end
console.timeEnd("Response time");

JavaScript's console.time() method is used to start a timer that tracks the duration of a specific operation or code block. It allows you to measure the execution time of a piece of code and analyze performance.

Here's how you can use console.time():

javascript
Copy code
console.time('myTimer'); // Start the timer

// Code block or operation to measure
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  // Perform some operation
}

console.timeEnd('myTimer'); // End the timer and log the elapsed time
In the above example, console.time('myTimer') starts the timer with the label "myTimer". Then, the code block inside the loop is executed. Finally, console.timeEnd('myTimer') stops the timer and logs the elapsed time since console.time() was called, labeled with "myTimer".

The output in the console will look like this:

makefile
Copy code
myTimer: 31.555ms
The timer label passed to console.time() and console.timeEnd() should be the same in order to correctly measure the elapsed time. You can use any string as the label.

The console.time() and console.timeEnd() methods are useful for profiling code execution and identifying bottlenecks. They are commonly used when analyzing the performance of different algorithms, optimizing code, or benchmarking different approaches.

Note that console.time() and console.timeEnd() are browser-specific methods and may not be available in all JavaScript environments, such as Node.js.

The console.time() and console.timeEnd() methods in JavaScript are used to measure the performance of a piece of code by tracking the amount of time it takes to execute. The console.time() method starts a timer, and the console.timeEnd() method stops the timer and prints the total runtime in milliseconds dotnettutorials.net.

You can use an optional label as the first argument of console.time() to describe what the timer is concerned about. When using multiple timers, it's recommended to use labels to differentiate between them dotnettutorials.net.

Here's an example of how to use console.time() and console.timeEnd():

console.time("exampleTimer");

// Some code to measure
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  let sum = i + 3;
}

console.timeEnd("exampleTimer");
In this example, the timer starts before the for loop and ends after it. The console will output the total time it took to execute the loop in milliseconds.

In summary, console.time() and console.timeEnd() are helpful methods for measuring the performance of your JavaScript code by tracking the time it takes to execute geeksforgeeks.org.
