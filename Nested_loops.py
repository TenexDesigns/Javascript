Nested loops in JavaScript refer to the concept of having one loop inside another loop. This allows you to perform repetitive tasks with multiple levels of iterations. You can nest loops of any type, such as for, while, or do-while loops. Here's an example of nested loops using for loops:

javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
    console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);
  }
}
In this example, we have an outer loop that iterates from 1 to 3 (i), and inside the outer loop, we have an inner loop that also iterates from 1 to 3 (j). The console.log statement inside the inner loop will be executed 9 times because the inner loop will complete its full iteration for each iteration of the outer loop. The output will be:

yaml
Copy code
i: 1, j: 1
i: 1, j: 2
i: 1, j: 3
i: 2, j: 1
i: 2, j: 2
i: 2, j: 3
i: 3, j: 1
i: 3, j: 2
i: 3, j: 3
Nested loops are useful when you need to work with multi-dimensional data structures, perform matrix operations, or solve problems that require multiple levels of iterations. Just keep in mind that nesting too many loops can lead to slower performance, so it's important to consider the complexity and efficiency of your code when working with nested loops.
